# Description

> 不枉我們奮鬥過 和壞人拼搏過
> 燃亮如熊熊烈火
> 當初有誰諷刺過 胡亂抨擊過 亦也走得過
> 或誰也會照笑 笑我傻 說這裏也有折磨
> 卻有你有我 曾無懼逐關過
> 重新開始我們上多課

Okay. My secure authentication system was proved insecure (see [here](https://github.com/samueltangz/ctf-archive-created/tree/master/20201006-hkcert-ctf/sign-in-please)) as it got exploited last year by a bunch of bad guys. I improved the system and you would not be able to eavesdrop the passwords ever again.

```bash
nc chalp.hkcert21.pwnable.hk 28167
```
