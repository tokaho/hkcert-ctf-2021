# Description

Seems the VM also have some CrYp70000 functionality.

They use this program to communicate and send flags over the air :thinking: Can we stole the flag if we have the traffic and the encrypt server?

(The VM challenges shares the same VM binary)

(P.S. `cryptoooo` and `output.txt` is that we capture from their local server)

(Update at 13/11 13:48: People in København loves to use nushell. If you are using bash, the equivalent command is `echo -n "f22ae46a891454ab2b3ef2b316357c34" | ./vm cryptoooo`.)
